Ove had, as usual, gotten up ten minutes earlier. He could not make head nor tail of people who overslept
and blamed it on "the alarm clock not ringing." Ove had never owned an alarm clock in his entire life. 
He woke up at quarter to six and that was when he got up. Every morning for the almost four decades they 
had lived in this house, Ove had put on the coffee percolator, using exactly the same amount of coffee as 
on any other morning, and then drank a cup with his wife. One measure for each cup, and one extra for the 
potâ€”no more, no less. People didn't know how to do that anymore, brew some proper coffee. In the same way 
as nowadays nobody could write with a pen. Because now it was all computers and espresso machines. And where 
was the world going if people couldn't even write or brew a pot of coffee?
